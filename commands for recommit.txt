These are the commands for recommiting in the same master or branch.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)Since folder already initialised with git so no need for re-initialising again.

2)But the changed file or added file/folder has to be brought to staging area for commiting and pushing.
 
   git add .
   
3)commit the changes..
  
   git commit -m "second time commit"
   
4)connection already established with the online git to local git so no need for 2nd time git remote command.
   
5)pushing the committed changes..

   git push    //no need to specify origin master as first commit was already in the same origin
